Your company sells products online or you build an web / mobile application. You certainly receive daily lots of support emails and it's hard to manage them.
The problem is that many of your customers' questions are repetitive and trivial:

- How to change my password
- How do I subscribe
- What are the payment options
- I cannot log out

Of course you can have predefined answers and macros to answer all these questions. It will only take you a couple of minutes, right?

Well, yes and no.

Sure, it's so simple to copy and paste an answer about how to change the password, but what's for your company and your daily operations? 

By building a knowledge base you gain so many advantages.

## 1. Educate
You can write an article about how to solve a problem step by step. That way the customer really learns how to resolve this problem, or how to proceed with a complex procedure on his own.

## 2. Illustrate
You can add screenshots, gifs and videos to make it easier for your users to follow the instructions.

## 3. Create a reference
Now your customers know that if they need to resolve their problems quickly and successfully they can use the knowledge base as a reference.

## 4. Create different levels of access
You most probably have various SLAs and offer different level of support for your customers, according their needs or their pricing plans. You can create rules inside your knowledge base and create documents tailored to each customer needs.

## 5. Create an internal knowledge base
You can use it for your internal documentation, to avoid sending back and forth emails within the company, or keeping all the information in off-line documents.

## 6. Save time
Your support agents don't have to spent time in answering all these repetitive questions. They can use this time to handle more difficult and time-consuming tasks.

## 7. Get insights
A lot of commercial solutions to build a knowledge base give you the option to track the searching terms that your customers have used. You can use the most common terms to create new articles, or to provide better services. Moreover you can find out the volume of customers that have reached out, while using the knowledge base.
