Hi everybody! 
My name is Georgia and I am a cheerful, optimistic and happy person. 

I love helping people out and supporting or guiding them any way I can. During my work as a Customer Success Manager I've learned to listen to people, trying to become helpful to their problems and concerns. To show compassion and empathy.

Being a mathematician, I've developed skills such as problem solving and decomposition. Optimization is definitely my thing, and I really enjoy developing strategies to provide the best and the most efficient solutions possible. 

I love coding and that's why I also have a BSc and MSc degree in Computer Science. I consider myself to be more of a Python enthusiast, but I love diving into new technologies and learning new stuff. I am also a computer programming instructor and teach skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, git flow and lots more. 


I currently work as a Customer Support Consultant. I help many SaaS, tech and non-tech companies to:

+ build their help center in order to educate their customers and reduce their support tickets
+ establish procedures for their company's support department
+ create automations and rules to reduce metrics like the First Responce Time or increase metrics like the Satisfaction Rate
+ implement and customize support tools, such as Zendesk, Freshdesk and more and integrate them with powerfull CRMs such as Salesforce or Intercom
+ work with the APIs and write custom scripts to migrate data from an old support app to a new one
+ build a custom help center in Zendesk or any other similar tool by editing the HTML, CSS and JavaScript and give a personalized and unique touch and feel at any help center
+ create reports and plots for all the important KPIs any company should track, by using e.g. Zendesk's GoodData. 
+ setting up and apply the integrations for the following apps & tools: Totango, Zendesk, GoodData, Zopim, Mixpanel, Pipedrive, Zapier, Workato, Intercom, Asana, Slack, GitHub, Lucidchart, Google Drive
